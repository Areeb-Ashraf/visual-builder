Create 4-6 logical steps that build upon each other. For each step, provide:

1. A clear, descriptive title
2. A detailed description explaining the concept
3. A specific image prompt for DALL-E (be very descriptive, mention style, colors, composition)
4. A voiceover script that's engaging and educational (2-3 sentences)

Return your response as a JSON array with this exact structure:
[

    "description": "Detailed explanation here",
    "image_prompt": "Detailed image description here",
    "voiceover_script": "Engaging narration script here"

Make sure the content is:
- Age-appropriate for ${ageLevel}
- Clear and progressive (each step builds on the previous)
- Visual (descriptions that can be illustrated)
- Engaging and educational
